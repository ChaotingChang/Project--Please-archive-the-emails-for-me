## Project Description
This project aims to do an automatic income email detection, cleaning and classification. The application of this project is to reduce the time for customer service agents when companies receive emails from clients.  

The detection part includes to detect the email language and email type (spam or not spam). The cleaning part aims to do the text cleaning, email content cleaning, the email title (receiver, date and time, etc) cleaning or even email translation. The classification part is focused on transfering the text into different array (Tfidf), testing different machine learning methods and hyperparameter tunning. And last, if I have time, I will try to put the project into production, which means that put it to a docker and do everything automatically.

<a name="hypotheses-/-questions"></a>

## Hypotheses / Questions
* What data/business/research/personal question you would like to answer? 
* What is he context for the question and the scientific or business application? 
* What are the hypotheses you would like to test in order to answer your question?  
Frame your hypothesis with statistical/data languages (i.e. define Null and Alternative Hypothesis). You can use formulas if you want but that is not required.

<a name="dataset"></a>

## Dataset
* Personal gmail: As I can't find a proper email dataset, I am going to use my emails from gmail to see if I can do something or not.

<a name="cleaning"></a>

## Cleaning
Describe your full process of data wrangling and cleaning. Document why you chose to fill missing values, extract outliers, or create the variables you did, etc, as well as your thinking process.

<a name="analysis"></a>

## Analysis
* Overview the general steps you will go through to analyze your data in order to test your hypothesis.
* Document each step of your data exploration and analysis.
* Include charts to demonstrate the effect of your work. 
* If you use ML in your final project, describe your feature selection process.

<a name="model-training-and-evaluation"></a>

## Model Training and Evaluation
*Include this section only if you chose to include ML in your project.*
* Describe how you trained your model, the results you obtained, and how you evaluated those results.
* 
    - Natural language processing
    - Unsupervised learning
    - Artificial Neural Network
    - SVM, Naive Bayes, or random forest classification
    - Docker or Azure (optional)


<a name="conclusion"></a>

## Conclusion
* Summarize your results. What do they mean?
* What can you say about your hypotheses?
* Interpret your findings in terms of the human-understandable question you try to answer.

<a name="future-work"></a>

## Future Work
Address any questions you were unable to answer, or any next steps or future extensions to your project.

<a name="workflow"></a>

## Workflow
